<div class="boxed1"> The me of the screen project was very conceptually challenging for me. I found it hard to understand and show all of the qualitative and quantitative data collected. After the initial brainstorming I began my auto-ethnography. I found it easier to begin with simply observing how I use the phone camera, what aspects I used, how I use them, why I use them. I generally categorized this and divided the information into qualitative and quantitative information. Following the critique on this research I decided to really watch and collect information on the who, what, where, when, why, and how of the photo taking process. This information allowed me to really understand what I was thinking, feeling and my overall interaction with the phone camera. 
</div>

<div class="boxed2"> This led to the first prototype ideation. It was very focused on the separate interactions required to take the photo. The whole infographic forced the viewer to move down through the photo taking process. After critiques and further iteration upon this idea I found that it was not the direction I wanted to move in. It felt very separated with little visual connection to the phone camera software and appearance. It also lacked overall connection between elements on the page. 
</div>

<div class="boxed3"> Following critiques, I had an idea about using the phone camera within the design by using QR codes. This meant the user had to pull out their phone to more from the introduction to analysis of information within the infographic. 
</div>

<div class="boxed4">Purple curved forms: representations of the daily usage of phone camera
The form was simplified to show the highest and lowest peak times during each day
Orange rectangular shape is meant to represent a phone
The phone shows the phone screen on – which connects to the next part of the infographic 
The background is patterned – visible within the top corner is the QR code which would link to the website (currently does not link to real website)
Meant to show the connectivity and actual usage of the phone camera
</div>

<div class="boxed5">The pop up at the top of the screen acts as the title – it follows the same set up as the pop up that appears when scanning a QR code
Green blocks divide the three main aspects of the phone camera
The left image is representative of what it is physically like to take phones
Includes the shutter, screen flashing back, option menu at the top
The right shape is representative of the categories the pone can be placed in 
As the user moves through the photo options the photos change to show each category 
They move within the same manner the iPhone camera setting (video, photo, portrait, etc) do
The bottom shape represents two things
The first is the slider – it shows the range of emotions portrayed by the photos and their connection to actually taking the photo
It follows the visual method of changing the exposure on an iPhone camera
The next is the meaning of colour shown by three filters – this connects to the menu options and settings provided within the phone camera as well as the colour control within the photos
The colour and emotional aspect of the photos are displayed on the same shape to show their connection. The colour itself can impact the mood of the photo or the mood while taking the photo
The composition as a whole represents the user floating in the center between the three shapes. They are grounded by the emotions and understanding of colour within their photos. They then turn to functionality and physically taking the photo next. 
</div>

<div class="boxed6"> Is an add on to the final website
As the user scrolls down the page they are presented with a more traditional way of viewing information
This allows them to make connections between each section of the infographic and their experience with their phone camera
Kind of acts like a legend but explains what is occurring visually after they had their own interpretation
Gives them context of the overall purpose and intent of the infographic
